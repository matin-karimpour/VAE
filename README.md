# Variational Autoencoder 

A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a generative AI algorithm that uses deep learning to generate new content, detect anomalies and remove noise.
In this repository implemented customizable VAE model with PyTorch.

*Fig 1 In variational autoencoders, the loss function is composed of a reconstruction term (that makes the encoding-decoding scheme efficient) and a regularisation term (that makes the latent space regular).
